# KannadaVoiceAI-Gradio-Based Speech Processing System

## Overview
This project is a Gradio-based web application that integrates multiple AI-powered speech processing features, including:
- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts spoken language into text using Google Speech Recognition.
- **Translation**: Translates the transcribed text into a selected target language.
- **Emotion Detection**: Analyzes the sentiment or emotion expressed in the transcribed text.
- **Voice Cloning**: Synthesizes speech from the transcribed text, imitating a specific voice.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Gradio for an interactive web-based experience.
- **Real-time Speech Processing**: Converts speech to text with minimal latency.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Allows users to translate the transcribed text into various languages.
- **Emotion Analysis**: Detects emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality.
- **Voice Cloning**: Uses AI-driven synthesis to generate voice output.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install gradio googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 speechrecognition numpy librosa torch
```

## Usage
Run the application using:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once the server starts, access the Gradio interface via the provided URL.
